# Overview

`periph` is continuously tested on Windows 10 but no hardware link is yet to be
implemented. This is a goal to make it work in the future.

The FT232H is likely going to be the first supported hardware link. It can be
bought on [Adafruit for
15$USD](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ft232h-breakout/overview).
