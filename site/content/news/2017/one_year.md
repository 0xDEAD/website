The idea of the project came up in early 2016 as I
([Marc-Antoine](https://github.com/maruel))  was working on a work-in-progress
(WIP) project named [dlibox](https://github.com/maruel/dlibox) but only in the
summer of 2016 I saw that there was real value into making the Hardware
Abstraction Layer (HAL) a real project. The working name of the project was
`pio` but everyone agreed it was a bad name. :)

The first [first
commit](https://github.com/google/periph/commit/dc9a06ba33ceca8dfbdc3607a52a90f1ae9042bf)
as a separate git repository was on September 28th 2016 but the code had been
worked on from within the dlibox repository back to August 2016. There was
already the core concepts of automatic host detection and registered drivers,
separation of HAL interfaces, device drivers and host drivers.

As [Thorsten](https://github.com/tve) said, the library has probably been
rewritten 10 times since then. :) For a long time I delayed making the project
public as I thought " _as long as the library doesn't have users, I don't mind
making breaking changes_ ". ðŸ’£

In April 2017 the github repository was made public but not marketed at all as I
still felt a lot of things weren't _right_ in the designs. Albeit a few
weeks later it was listed on
[opensource.google.com](https://opensource.google.com/projects/periph-io) and
people discovered the project.

A year after coming up with the initial core design, v1.0.0 of periph [was
tagged](https://github.com/google/periph/commit/2d212de54aa9510afd901f8faafd8c665e3d441f)
on August 10th but v2.0.0 is getting released as many design elements were fine
tuned...
