Have you found incoherences in the [APIs](/x/periph)? Does an interface-specific
[registry] (/project/design/#interface-specific-registries) needs refactoring or
is hard to use? Is a [device driver](/x/periph/devices#pkg-subdirectories)
missing options?  We are now planning v3 to polish the APIs. This is a major
release which will permit small breaking changes, as defined by the
[compatibility guarantee](/project/library/#compatibility-guarantee).

Now is the time to report these issues and voice your opinion! Please [file a
bug](https://github.com/google/periph/issues/new) or reach out on #periph on the
Gophers slack. You can find the slack invite on the top right of this page.

It is slated for around Q1 of 2018. It is not an hard date, we will release once
we feel we reached the desired polish level. You can view the currently slated
changes via the [API breaking]
(https://github.com/google/periph/labels/API%20breaking) label.
