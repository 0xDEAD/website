# Overview

[periph.io/x/periph/devices/apa102](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices/apa102)
provides support for APA-102 LEDs. Their main advantage over WS2812b LEDs are:

- works over SPI at higher clock rate
- high contrast supported via dual PWM, one 5 bit and one 8 bit leading to a
  total range of 13 bits.

The main disadvantage is slightly higher cost.


# Driver

The driver as the following functionality:

- Full 13 bits support
- [Color temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_temperature)
- Intensity scaling


# Tool

Use
[cmd/apa102](https://github.com/google/periph/blob/master/cmd/apa102/main.go) to
play with the lights without programming. It can stream an image to create
[digital light painting](https://learn.adafruit.com/dotstar-pi-painter/overview).
